# fractionalDynamicsNeuralModel
Use fractional equations to generate brain signals. Contains codes for regenerating figures for Life Expectancy project

The common codes need to be on Matlab path.
Slope computation requires FOOOF repository and codes from 4srihy/SlopeFooofCodes. It should also be on path.
